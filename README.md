# CTimer
CTimer class module with ITimer interface

This is a code-based timer object for generic use in VB6 and 32-bit VBA.

The timer object is interface driven and therefore don't need necessarily a form as host.

The subfolder "Assembler Source Code" is only for information and not needed for using the object.
